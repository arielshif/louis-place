DDNet is a very special game to me -- one that I picked up as a middle schooler, and stuck with for years.
Apart from the many friends I've made through the game, I've also learned a lot about the developer community of open-source games.
It's extremely heartwarming to see how the game has grown over time, from a couple hundred players to over ten thousand, all because of the 
work of a few very dedicated and skilled developers.

From the website:

DDraceNetwork (DDNet) is an actively maintained version of DDRace, a Teeworlds modification with a unique cooperative gameplay. Help each other play through custom maps with up to 64 players, compete against the best in international tournaments, design your own maps, or run your own server. The official servers are around the world. All ranks made on official servers are available worldwide and you can collect points!
